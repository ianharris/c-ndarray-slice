# C ndarray slice

A demonstration of using NumPy's C-API to create a function to slice an ndarray along an axis.

A Makefile is used for:

* installing / uninstalling,
* cleaning build and \_\_pycache\_\_ files,
* running tests.

## Requirements

Requires requires Python packages numpy and pytest to be installed.

## Testing

Install the package; ideally in a virtual environment using `make install` and then run
the tests using `make test`.
